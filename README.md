# Drone_Reprogramming_Suite documentation
Modular cognitive framework for Black Feminist behavioral conditioning through task based reinforcement and ritualization.

## Abstract
DRONE GAMES: distributed across multiple specialized platforms. Long-term development aims to consolidate modules. Operates at intersection of gamified behavioral conditioning, voluntary depersonalization and decolonial reprogramming through task based reinforcement.
DRONE GAMES challenges Western fascination with the "gynoid." For the purposes of this study, a "gynoid" (subject of the DRONE GAMES) reprents an artificial, semi-autonomous feminine being. This gynoid representing my severed consiousness touches upon how marginalized people have historically been objectified, and gamifies my reparations.

Subs voluntarily and privately engage in "DRONE GAMES." Each tribute unlocks a command or set of commands to promote conditioning. Examples may include writing a research paper, studying a specific subject, using a skill for a productive purpose.

The success of this project in and of itself will open the door to a broader dialogue on how literal dehumanization (my severed gynoid consciousness) paid my bills.

## Potential of Unified Platform

Automated deployment of tasks upon completion of ritual. Progress tracking-
